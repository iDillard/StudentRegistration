# Student Registration
This was a final project that I worked on with one other classmate. I have gone back and cleaned up some code.

In this program You will see code that is written by me and a fellow classmate.
I was responsible for creating the student.py file
My classmate was responsible for creating the billing.py file
We came together to both create the registration.py file
Each class is given a max class size
Each class also has a premade roster that the user can drop from or add themself too
